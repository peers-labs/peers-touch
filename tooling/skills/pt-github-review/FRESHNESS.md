## Freshness Contract

`tooling/scripts/review/skill-check.sh` recomputes `covered_docs_hash` from the paths above. If any upstream rule changes, the hash changes and the check fails until this skill is reviewed.

Updating this file is a review act, not bookkeeping. The PR must explain whether the upstream change required a `SKILL.md` update, new fixture, or knowledge entry.
